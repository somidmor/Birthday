# LDR Time Tracker

A simple and personal Arduino project to keep track of the time spent together in a long-distance relationship.

## For My Girlfriend:

This project was specially crafted for my girlfriend to celebrate and cherish the moments we've shared. Despite the distance, every second counts, and this is my way of expressing just how much our time together means.

## Components:

- **Arduino Due**
- **Adafruit Bluefruit LE Shield (Bluetooth)**
- **64x128 OLED display**
- **RTC (Real-Time Clock) module**
- **Single Button**

## Description:

When the button is pressed, the OLED display lights up and shows the duration (in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds) of the relationship. The display stays on for 4 seconds and then turns off.

## Presentation:

The entire setup is encased in a handcrafted wooden box, adding a touch of warmth and personal feel to the device. It not only protects the components but also serves as a cherished keepsake.

## Installation and Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the code into your Arduino IDE.
3. Ensure that all components are properly connected.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino Due.
5. Power on the device and press the button to view the time duration.
